Why are you no ISP yet?","description":["While open source democratized access to software and enabled a very successful copy \u0026 paste, remix \u0026 fork approach to software engineering, there are still two important aspects of our digital infrastructure which are not easily accessible for anyone: open hardware and open networks.","However, concerning open networks, some groups already had some successes.","More than 10 years ago, in 2003 a couple of initiatives in Austria, Germany, Greece and other countries discovered in parallel that you could \"hack-open\" standard Wi-Fi routers and install mesh software on them. The combination of hackable cheap Wi-Fi routers and open source thus spund the creation of open networks (often also termed \"bottom-up networks\" or \"community wireless networks\"). By inverting the traditional role of ISPs and allowing anyone to be part of a community wireless network, these open networks were born.","Now, after ten years of development and research, some of these networks developed and flourished into large communities, covering vast areas. Some other networks dissappeared.","However the development of these individual community networks turned out, one thing is clear: mesh networking is here to stay. It is *the* way to do mobile ad-hoc networking for potentially moving networks nodes.","The talk will also explain the basics of mesh networking and OLSR.org in particular: how to get it running and experiement with it and how to connect devices over a mesh.","But just having a mesh running is only part of the story. You need to connect to the global Internet to become a \"real\" ISP. There are a couple of steps involved with that and lots of pitfalls. The presenter - also a pioneer of the community wireless network movement - will look back at 10 years of community wireless network development, draw some lessons learned and show a straight forward path to create your own ISP.","Next, the presenter will discuss current issues of mesh networking research and point out opportunities for further research.","The talk will close with a vision for the next ten years in mesh research and community wireless ISP research."],"speakers":[{"name":"Aaron Kaplan","avatar":"http://opensourcedays.mikstura.it/assets/speakers/Aaron_Kaplan.jpg","title":"Unix Programmer","description":"Aaron is the founder of the FunkFeuer free wireless community network in Austria.","social":{"world":"http://www.funkfeuer.at"}}]},{"id":118,"more_info":false,"start_at":" 2:30 pm","type":"break","title":"Break","description":[" "],"speakers":[]},{"id":119,"more_info":true,"start_at":" 3:00 pm","type":"talk","title":"TBA","description":["TBA"],"speakers":[]},{"id":120,"more_info":true,"start_at":" 3:20 pm","type":"talk","title":"Infracoding.
